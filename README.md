## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I did this project as a repetition of some React basics, but for one thing I got to try out a hook I hadn't used before: useImperativeHandle (See more in src/components/dialogs/Reset.tsx and src/components/game/Game.tsx).

### Continued development

Use more custom hooks, work on optimizing my code and using best practices. In the future I might also implement some bonus features, like improving the AI and adding game board size options like 4x4 or 5x5.
